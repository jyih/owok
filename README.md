[Owok](https://uwuowok.herokuapp.com/) is a two player, turn-based game based on Maplestory's popular, nostalgic mini-game: Omok. The rules of Owok are simple: successfully place 5 pieces in a row to win! üòã

# Getting Started

<details>
<summary>How do I run this project?</summary>

1. Clone this repo.

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:milkyomo/owok.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies from the root directory and update the contents of your requirements.txt file to match your Pipfile.lock

   ```bash
   pipenv install --dev -r dev-requirements.txt && pipenv install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   ```bash
   pipenv install psycopg2-binary
   ```

   ```bash
   pipenv install flask-socketio
   ```

   ```bash
   pipenv install eventlet==0.30.2
   ```

   ```bash
   pipenv lock -r > requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install dependencies from the `react-app` directory

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   ```bash
   npm install socket.io-client
   ```

4. In the `react-app` directory, create a `.env` file using the `.env.example` that will be used to define your desired `PORT` (preferably 5000).

5. In the root directory, create a `.env` file that will be used to define your environment variables.

   > Use the `.env.example` found in the root directory as a template. Use a secured combination of characters for your `SECRET_KEY`. The `DATABASE_URL` should be in the format of `postgresql://<database_user>:<password>@localhost/<database_name>`

6. Create a **user** using the same credentials in the `.env` file of the root directory with the ability to create databases

   ```bash
    psql -c "CREATE USER <database_username> PASSWORD '<password>' CREATEDB"
   ```

7. Create a **database** using the same credentials in the `.env` file of the root directory

   ```bash
    psql -c "CREATE DATABASE <database_name> WITH OWNER <database_username>"
   ```

8. Enter `pipenv` to migrate and seed your database

   ```bash
   pipenv shell
   ```

   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

   ```bash
   flask seed all
   ```

9. Inside of the `pipenv` shell, start the services in the root directory

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

10. In a separate terminal, start the services in the `react-app` directory

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

# Features

Users must select a sprite for their profile upon sign up!

![spriteselection](https://i.gyazo.com/94e183406b6abf9180faab93e1c966b7.gif)

If you do not want to make an account, feel free to use the Demo login!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89059894/164381675-781aa4d2-7b5d-4256-9687-78bb7178e6b2.png)

### Logged in users can perform the following actions:

- Host a game of Owok, or join other games of Owok as either a participant or a spectator
- Chat with other users inside games
- View replays of past games, move by move
- Change the privacy of games that they played
- Comment on replays
- Edit and delete their comments
- View their own profile or profiles of other users

### Notes on Privating a replay

  </p>

Pressing this lock on your replays will toggle the privacy feature! This feature allows you to hide replays from your profile! However, if the other participant in your replay does not have the game set as private, the replay will still show up on their profile.. üò• Your name will not be displayed to non-participants on the replay if you set yourself to private, though!

- Participants of game will be able to see the private person's name
- People who did not participate will NOT be able to see the private person's name
- The privated game will show up on the other participant's profile, but NOT on the privated person's profile
- You will be able to see all games, private or not private, on your own profile

# To-do/Future Features

This was the first time that I ever tried to implement game logic! There were definitely a lot of struggles throughout this whole process, especially when it came to implementing sockets to make the game actually playable between two people. I began the project with very simple logic with a hardcoded second player, but that all had to change when it came down to integrating sockets with the website. Just being able to place a piece was a great accomplishment, and the next came with calculating wins, and the final "aha!" moment came when a second player could finally successfully join the room! Of course, there is a LOT of room for improvement.. but that comes with anything in life! üòä

In the future, I want to implement more features to improve user experience, such as having a time limit for turns so players can't take forever to think, and having a forfeit button, as well as a draw button where both players can agree to draw the game. I also want to add moderator priveledges to better monitor comments and chats.

## To-do

- [x] Refactor game logic
- [x] Link to private rooms
- [ ] Mod priveledges
- [ ] Add forfeit button
- [ ] Add draw button
- [ ] More piece sets (pink teddy and panda!!)

# Debugging Log

**[04-13-2022]**

_Issue:_
Could not implement multiple foreign keys in Game referencing User (player_one and player_two)

_Solution:_
Implemented.

**[04-15-2022]**

_Issue:_
Replays were not properly playing the first move, which made the moves play out of order

_Solution:_
Found that the new game moves were storing with curly braces wrapping the coordinates inside
the string. Had to slice first and last character from string to remove curly braces
const movesArr = game?.moves?.slice(1, -1).split(",");

**[04-19-2022]**

_Issue:_
Datetime not saving to database correctly

_Solution:_
Removed invocation of datetime in models

**[04-20-2022]**

_Issue:_
Sockets: not persisting data across clients, and then later emitting information universally

_Solution:_
Added a custom hook useDidMountEffect to ensure that the useEffect does not trigger on page load. Added useState to ensure that the moves persist before setting the board and checking for win. joinRoom(socketRoom) useEffect.

**[04-21-2022]**

_Issue:_
Game would not save/create after completion. "Object not subscriptable"

_Solution:_
Needed to use dot notation (Python issue)

**[04-22-2022]**

_Issue:_
Player sprite remains after disconnecting

_Solution:_
Keep log of who joins and remove those who disconnect

**[04-22-2022]**

_Issue:_
Cannot place pieces on board edge

_Solution:_
Standardized all coordinate placements into quad digit string

**[04-22-2022]**

_Issue:_
Couldn't send messages only to specific rooms. Either broadcast to all or to none.

_Solution:_
Moved the socket.on to the parent component and passed down the React useState for messages to the Chat (child) component.
