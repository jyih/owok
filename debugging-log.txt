Could not implement multiple foreign keys in Game referencing User (player_one and player_two)

Solution:
Implemented.

Issue:
Replays were not properly playing the first move, which made the moves play out of order

Solution:
Found that the new game moves were storing with curly braces wrapping the coordinates inside
the string. Had to slice first and last character from string to remove curly braces
const movesArr = game?.moves?.slice(1, -1).split(",");
